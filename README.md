# FaceDetector

The program is built using Swift and utilizes the power of Apple's Vision framework, which provides high-level APIs for performing computer vision tasks. It leverages the front or rear camera of an iOS device to capture a live video feed or accepts an image or video from the device's photo library. Using the Vision framework, the program applies a face detection algorithm to analyze each frame or image and identifies the presence of faces.
